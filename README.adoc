WARNING: This gem is still under development.

== Functionality

This gem processes http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents following
a template for generating CSD International Standards. The following
outputs are generated.

* (Optional) An HTML preview generated directly from the Asciidoctor document,
using native Asciidocot formatting. 
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketting terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.
* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for CSD
International Standards. 
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable CSD standard drafts.
** Microsoft Word output (`.doc`), following the style conventions of the 
https://www.csd.org/csd-templates.html[CSD Standard Microsoft Word template]. 
(In development)
** PDF (forthcoming)
** HTML (forthcoming)

This AsciiDoc syntax for writing CSD standards is hereby named "AsciiCSD".

== Usage

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor a.adoc  # HTML output of Asciidoc file
$ asciidoctor -b csd -r 'asciidoctor-csd' a.adoc  # CSD XML output
----

The gem translates the document into CSD XML format, and then
validates its output against the CSD XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

TODO: The gem will then convert the XML to Word Document, HTML, and
PDF, and output those files with the appropriate file suffixes.
`lib/asciidoctor/csd/csd2wordhtml.rb` is work in progress, and not yet
integrated into the executable.

=== Content Warnings

The gem also realises several format checks as prescribed in ISO/IEC
DIR 2, and warns the user about them in the console:

* Numbers with what looks like dots instead of commas for decimal points.

* Groups of numbers without spacing for every three digits. (The gem attempts
to ignore CSD references.)

* No space before percent sign.

* No bracketing of tolerance in percentage (e.g. `15 ± 7 % .`)

* No recommendations, permissions or requirements (detected by keyword) in:
foreword, scope, introduction, term examples and examples, notes, footnotes.

* No subclauses that are the only child of a clause. (In clauses, annexes, or
scopes.)

* 5 levels of subclause nesting. (Never actuated, AsciiDoc only permits 4
levels of subsections.)

* Non-CSD/IEC reference turning up as normative.

* Term definition starts with an article, or ends with a period.

* Title intro or title part appears in only one of French or English.

== Approach

=== Document model

The CSD Standard Document model is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model].

The CSD format ("CSD XML") intends to introduce rigour into the CSD
standards authoring process, and is prescribed in a separate document.

CSD XML is still under development, but it already contains all the markup
needed to render a CSD document into HTML.

WARNING: The current RNG model of CSD XML is out of sync with the UML.

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of CSD standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigour and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored.

Note that in order to generate HTML preview output close to what is intended
in the CSD standard, the Asciidoc
document includes a fair amount of formatting instructions (e.g. disabling
section numbering where appropriate, the titling of Appendixes as Annexes), as
well as CSD boilerplate text, and predefined section headers (sections are
recognised by fixed titles such as `Normative References`). Authoring CSD
standards in this fashion assumes that users will be populating an Asciidoc
template, and not removing needed formatting instructions.

=== Features not visible in HTML preview

The gem uses built-in Asciidoc formatting as much as possible, so that users
can retain the ability to preview documents; for _Terms and Definitions_
clauses, which have a good deal of explicit structure, macros have been
introduced for semantic markup (admitted terms, deprecated terms, etc). The
default HTML output of an Asciidoc-formatted CSD document is quite close to the
intended final output, with the following exceptions. Note that the final
outputs of the conversion (Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML) do not have these exceptions,
and comply with the CSD Standard specifications.

* _Terms and Definitions_: each term is marked up as an unnumbered subclause,
the semantic markup of alternate and other terms is not rendered visually.

* _Formulas_: Asciidoctor has no provision for the automated numbering of
csdlated block formulas ("stem"), and does not display the number assigned a
block formula in its default HTML processor—although it does provide automated
numbering of examples. Formula numbering is provided in the final outputs
of the conversion.

* _Missing elements_: The document model does not yet include Asciidoc elements
that do not appear to be relevant to CSD Standards; these will be ignored in
generating CSD XML. Those elements include:
* sidebars (`aside`) (as distinct from warnings),
* ASCII art/preformatted text (`literal`) (as distinct from sourcecode listings),
* page breaks (`thematic break`).

* _Markup_: Some connecting text which is used to convey markup structure is
left out: in particular, `DEPRECATED` and `SOURCE` (replaced by formatting
macros).

* _Tables_: Table footnotes are treated like all other footnotes: they are
rendered at the bottom of the document, rather than the bottom of the table,
and they are not numbered separately.

* _Cross-references_: Footnoted cross-references are indicated with the reference
text `fn` in csdlation, or `fn:` as a prefix to the reference text. The default
HTML processor leaves these as is: if no reference text is given, only `fn`
will be displayed (though it will still hyperlink to the right reference).

* _References_: The convention for references is that CSD documents are cited
without brackets by CSD number, and optionally year, whether they are normative
or in the bibliography (e.g. `CSD 20483:2013`); while all other references are
cited by bracketed number in the bibliography (e.g. `[1]`). The default HTML
processor treats all references the same, and will bracket them (e.g. `[CSD
20483:2013]`). For the same reason, CSD references listed in the bibliography
will be listed under an CSD reference, rather than a bracketed number.

* _References_: References are rendered cited throughout, since they are
automated. For that reason, if reference is to be made to both an undated and a
dated version of an CSD reference, these need to be explicitly listed as
separate references. (This is not done in the Rice model document, which lists
CSD 6646, but under _Terms and Definitions_ cites the dated CSD 6646:2011.

* _References_: CSD references that are undated but published have their date
indicated under the CSD standards format in an explanatory footnote. Because of
constraints introduced by Asciidoctor, that explanation is instead given in
square brackets in Asciidoc format.

* _Annexes_: Subheadings cannot preserve subsection numbering, while also
appearing inline with their text (e.g. Rice document, Annex B.2): they appear
as headings in separate lines.

* _Annexes_: Cross-references to Annex subclauses are automatically prefixed
with `Clause` rather than `Annex` or nothing.

* _Metadata_: Document metadata such as document numbers, technical committees
and title wording are not rendered in the default HTML output.

* _Patent Notice_: Patent notices are treated and rendered as a subsection of
the introduction, with an explicit subheading.

* _Numbering_: The numbering of figures and tables is sequential in the default
HTML processor: it does not include the Clause or Annex number. This,
_Figure 1_, not _Figure A.1_.

* _Notes_: There is no automatic note numbering by the default HTML processor.

* _Review Notes_: The reviewer on the review note is not displayed.

* _Keys_: Keys to formulas and figures are expected to be marked up as
definition lists consistently, rather than as inline prose.

* _Figures_: Simple figures are marked up as images, figures containing
subfigures as examples. Numbering by the default HTML processor may be
inconsistent. Subfigures are automatically numbered as independent figures.

* _Markup_: The default HTML processor does not support CSS extensions such as
small caps or strike through, though these can be marked up as CSS classes
through custom macros in Asciidoctor: a custom CSS stylesheet will be needed to
render them.



TODO: May need to only encode figures as examples.

== Document Attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. These include:

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see CSD deliverables: The different types of
CSD publications) (mandatory). The permitted types are: `standard, governance`.

`:technical-committee:`:: The name of the relevant CSD technical committee
(mandatory)

`:language:` :: The language of the document (only `en` for now)  (mandatory)


The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.


== Data Models

The CSD Standard Document format is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model]. Details of
this general model can be found on its page.
